hw-04 - Event Handling 

Link to GitHub Pages: `[insert your clickable hyperlink here]`

## Purpose

The purpose of this assignment is to practice event handling with JavaScript.  

## Instructions

1. Background material to support this assignment is provided below in the Resources section.  

1. You can find a reference for what your final webpage should look like and how it should behanve in the "reference" folder. 

1. Create a GitHub Page for your repo and add the link to your GitHub Page above where you see `[insert your clickable hyperlink here]`. 

1. Clone this repo and work locally. Be sure to push the final version of your code (and any significant updates along the way) before submitting. 

1. Using the index.html file included in your repo an *external* stylesheet (no styling should be done inline; it should all be done via external css), and an *external* JavaScript file (no JavaScript should be present in your index.html file) please do the following: 
   - Make all font on your webpage Arial. 
   - Add a title: "hw-04".
   - Add a centered header: "Event Handling". 
   - Add three svg circles (circle1, circle2, circle3) to your webpage. They should show on the page side-by-side, in one row. Each should be a different color. The left-most (circle1) and right-most (circle3) circles should have bold black borders. 
   - Add the following event handling:
     - **circle1**: Add text in the center of the circle that shows how many times this svg has been clicked on. Each time the svg is clicked on, the count should update.
     - **circle2**: When this svg is mousedover a bold black border should show. On mouseout, the bold black border should disappear. 
     - **circle3**: Add functionality such that clicking on this svg hides it from the page. Clicking on the blank space the svg was in should un-hide the svg from the page. Hint: think about setting opacity in your css to show or hide the circle.
